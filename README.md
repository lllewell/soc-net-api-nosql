# Social Network API

## Description

As a developer of a social media startup I have made a social network API using mongoose.


## Installation

The user needs to install the `mongoose` and `express`dependencies to utilize this program.

## Usage

Using Insomnia the user will be able to utilize the different route requests to obtain/provide information from/to the social network API.
